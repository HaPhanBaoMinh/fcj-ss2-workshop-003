Now we have a model without having to write a single line of code. So cool!!!

Next, we will prepare a dataset for predicting data from the model we created in the previous step. In this file, we will not have the **Temperature** column, as we will use the model to predict the value of this column.

### 1. Prepare the Dataset

This is the dataset file that we will use to predict the value of the **Temperature** column.

Similar to step 5.1, we will create a dataset from the CSV file we prepared.

Here, I have created a new dataset from the CSV file named **Predict_data**.
