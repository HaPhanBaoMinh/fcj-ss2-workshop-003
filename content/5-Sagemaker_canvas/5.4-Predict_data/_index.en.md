Now we have a model and a dataset to predict the value of the **Temperature** column.

### 1. Prediction

We access the model we created in the previous step and select **Predict**.

Here we choose **Manual**.

Next, we select the dataset we prepared in the previous step.

Then we wait for the results.

### 2. Results

We will have results as follows:

The model has predicted the value of the **Temperature** column based on the model we created.

### 3. Note:

If we have a larger and more detailed dataset, the model will make more accurate predictions.

In this example, I only predicted the value of the **Temperature** column based on the value of **Humidity**.

From this example, you can apply it to many different problems.
