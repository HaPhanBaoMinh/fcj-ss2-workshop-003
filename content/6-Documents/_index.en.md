## Conclusion

Through this lab, we have:
- Learned how to use AWS IoT Core to receive data from devices.
- Learned how to use AWS Lambda to process data before storing it in DynamoDB.
- Learned how to use AWS SageMaker Canvas to build predictive models.

From this lab, we can build a complete IoT system that involves receiving data from devices, processing that data, and making predictions.
